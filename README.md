So I felt really confident with how this one came out, my only complaint was that I couldn't get a computer player in time.
I found a bug last minute that the counting function wasn't clearing out after my for loops.
ended up fixing it by makeing it go through a last check that will always be false so the winCount returns to 1.
Definetly glad I had the extra time cause I probably shouldn't have done connect 4 with this project.
But this was a really good project I feel that I learned and am way more confident with messing with js.
